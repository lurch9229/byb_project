1)  What is normalisation?
    It is the process of organising data in the database. It creates tables and establishes relationships between said tables using rules 
    to protect data and make the database flexible by eliminating redundancies and inconsistant dependancies 

2)  When is a table in 1NF?
    If ALL columns contain only atomic values. Each column can only have 1 value for each row in the table. 

3)  When is a table 2NF?
    If each attribute that is not part of the primary key depends on ALL parts of the primary key.
    If it is in 1NF and has a single attribute UID
    If it is in 1NF and has a multiple attribute UID and every regular attribute not part of the UID is dependant on ALL attributes in the multi-attribute UID, not just one attribute of the UID

4)   When is a table 3NF?
    A relation that is in First and Second Normal Form and in which no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key, then it is in Third Normal Form (3NF).

5)  What is a foreign key?
    A foreign key is a column or columns of data in one table that refers to the unique data values -- often the primary key data -- in another table. Foreign keys link together two or more tables in a relational database.
