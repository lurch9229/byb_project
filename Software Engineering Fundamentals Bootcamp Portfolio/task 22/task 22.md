Task 22 involves making a SQL Table

Created a list of students that have attributes:
    STU_NUM, STU_SNAME, STU_FNAME, STU_INITIAL
    STU_STARTDATE, COURSE_CODE, PROJ_NUM

STU_NUM is a primary key used for searching the database

will return all records that have a COURSE_CODE OF 305

Changes STU_NUM 07's COURSE_CODE to 304

Deletes student named Jamie Lannister

Changes PROJ_NUM to for students that started before a date and has a COURSE_CODE >= 201

Will Finally delete the table entirely using DROP TABLE
