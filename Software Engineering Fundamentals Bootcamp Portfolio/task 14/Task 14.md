Task 14 is working with lists to search within and sort them

array_lists.py

Has a Class named Album
Has attributes for album_name, artist and num_of_songs

A list is created containing 5 albums
It is then sorted by num_of_songs and printed out
First and last songs positions in list are switched

A second list is created containing another 5 songs
list 1 contents is added into list 2
2 more songs are added to the combined list
List is sorted alphabetically using album_name
A binary search is performed to find a specified album

merge_sort.py

Sorts a list of strings by order of length of characters

merge() takes 2 sections of the list to compared by lengths and adds them to a new list
then it appends any remaining elements and organises them by length, and places them between the 2 elements in the new list

merge_sort() then sorts the list using a divide and conquer method
which divides the list into smaller sections to find each higher value to place them in the sorted list

sort_and_search.py

Demonstrates different ways to sort and search within a list
